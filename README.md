# mscore-plugin-color-melody
This is a Musescore QML plugin script that naively colors the melody-lines on a standard notation chord-melody staff.

Music Composition & Notation

Color Melody-Line Notes Plugin

This plugin will make a naive attempt to color notes red to mark the
melody-line of the score. It simply assumes that the highest pitched
note is the melody note. To use it you do have to select one, or all,
of the measures on one staff. This is my first plugin so it certainly
is not sophisticated. While it is of use to me, my main goal here was
to gain some experience making a plugin. Please feel free to improve on
this.
